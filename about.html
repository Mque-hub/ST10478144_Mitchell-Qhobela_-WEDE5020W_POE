                        Meet Mitchell Qhobela. The Photographer behind the lenses and artwork. Mitchell Founded Cathel Photography in 2020. Whilst in the middle of a life changing pandemic, the Corona Virus, He found his gift in art created by the lenses.
                        <br> He started the business in a small town in Free State called Welkom. From 2021, he left his home town to gain the experience in Gauteng, Johannesburg. In his experience he has discovered that "what really matters is not about pressing a button to take the picture, it's about being able to understand the beauty of the moment. The emotions, the atmosphere, and the gift of the present moment."

                "When we first contacted you, we were looking for someone to take photos for our charity drive. When everything was set and done, you went far and beyond our expectation. You captured moments that not even we thought had imagined that they actually happened. Thank you for your excellent work, we didn't even wait long to recieve our edited photos." The Grace Foundation

                "I remember so well of the time I recieved a surpise farewell dinner for my services of being a doctor for more than 20 years. I look at those photos and I relive the event every time I look at them. When you say that you capture the elegance, I can surely testify on your behalf." Dr L.P Mokokoane
